# The Birds App

Hi! I made this app using the template provided

### How to run project

1. Copy `.env` to a `.env.local` filling in appropriate values
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run build` to build the project
4. Run `npm run preview` to start the preview server

### Project Notes and Clarifications

- **Bird "In Other Languages" section**: The application assumes English and Latin as the other bird languages since these are the only ones provided by the API.
- **Bird Notes**: The notes functionality only includes `timestamp` and `comment` fields as these are the data points provided by the API. The note creation modal is also limited to these required fields.
- **Styling**: The application is styled using Tailwind CSS :rainbow:
